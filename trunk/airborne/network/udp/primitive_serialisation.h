/**
 *  Collection of serialisation functions for serialising (packing) and unserialising (unpacking) primitives
 *
 *	Most of this code has been taken from section 7.4. "Serializationâ€”How to Pack Data" 
 *	of "Beej's Guide to Network Programming" which can be found 
 *	at http://beej.us/guide/bgnet/output/html/singlepage/bgnet.html#serialization
 *
 *	These functions handle the issue of converting from host byte-order to network byte-order
 *	by always explicitly converting the logical bitwise representation of the primitive
 *	data-type into a string representation in network byte-order (and back again to unpack).
 *	Unless I'm horribly deluded as to how this can be done.
 *
 *	There is probably a performance hit in utilising the serialisation functions of
 *	primitive_serialisation, as oppossed to alternate methods that use hton functions.
 *
 *	All of the data-types supported in this module are ones that have explicit sizes 
 *	defined (uint8_t, uint16_t, int32_t, float32, etc).
 *	This should make them portable when serialising/unserialising data within programs
 *	that work in different memory environments, ie 32 bit vs 64 bit.  However none of this
 *	has been tested extensively.
