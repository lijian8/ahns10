This Wiki outlines the 2010 HLO's, SR's and roles that the project must meet to satisfy the objectives.

==High Level Objectives==

 ===HLO-1 Platform===

  A platform should be developed and maintained to facilitate flight and on board hardware intergration.

 ===HLO-2 Localisaton===

  The system should be capable of determining its position with the aid of image processing within an indoor environment to an appropriate time resolution.

 ===HLO-3 State Estimation===

  A method of estimating the states of the helicopter system should be designed and implemented. The resolution of the estimations should faciliate their employment in the control system design.

 ===HLO-4 Autonomous Hovering Flight===

  An autopilot system should be developed to enable sustained indoor autonomous hovering flight. The control system should be designed to enable future ingress and egress manerourvers to longitudinal and hovering flight.

 ===HLO-5 Ground Control Station===

  A ground control station that supports appropriate command and system setting input and data display and logging should be developed. The design should be derived from previous AHNS developments and enable future ground station developments.

 ===HLO-6 Communications===

  The communications system should enable transfer of control, state and localisation data to the ground control station. It should provide with a flexible wireless datalink available on consumer-electronic devices.
