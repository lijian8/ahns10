#summary Wifi configuration for AHNS devices.

== TCP/IP Connection ==
All devices need to connect to the ground station 802.11 modem (Linksys WRT54GL router).
Router is preferable to ad-hoc:
  * due to full 802.11g speeds
  * ability to connect and disconnect without wifi card reconfiguration
  * inbuilt dhcp and dns servers
  * provides access to Internet through connection of wired network link

== Router Information ==
  * SSID: heliconnect10
  * Channel: 11
  * Encryption: None
  * Gateway: 192.168.1.1
  * Subnet: 255.255.255.0
  * Username: ahns
  * Password: ahns

== AHNS device IP assignment ==
|| *Device* || *IP* ||
||Linksys WRT54GL (Server)||192.168.1.1||
