#summary The Architecture of the on-board hardware for the AHNS helicopter

= Introduction =

This Wave contains information on the proposed hardware components for the project. Feel free to add, subtract, multiply and divide anything you want. <br /> Or just leave your thoughts. These are all just initial ideas, not final design solutions. Note that the prices are in US dollars, and do not include postage.

==Flight Computer==

The proposed Flight Computer is the Gumstix Overo Fire. <font color="#FF0000> ($219.00 USD) </font>
<br />The following link points to the [http://www.gumstix.com/store/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=226 Gumstix Overo Fire information page.]


It uses the TI OMAP 3503 which we can install Linux or Windows CS on:
<br />The following link points to [http://focus.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/omap3503.pdf TI OMAP 305 information.]


The Pinto expansion board should be adequete for our purposes:    <font color="#FF0000>    ($27.50 USD) </font>
<br />The following link points to the [http://www.gumstix.com/store/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=239 Gumstix Pinto Expansion Board.]


This will give us access to:
  * 2 x UARTS
  * 6 x PWM lines
  * 6 x ADC lines
  * 8 x GPIO
  * 1 x I2C
  * 1 x SPI with 2 CS lines (We can connect two devices to the SPI but can only communicate to one at a time.)
  * 1 x Image sensor input (including sensor control data).
  * 1 x Bluetooth
  * 1 x Wifi

==Blackfin Camera==

SRV-1 Blackfin Camera with 500MHz Analog Devices Blackfin BF537 processor, 32MB SDRAM, 4MB Flash, and choice of Omnivision OV9655 <br />1.3 megapixel camera or OV7725 VGA low-light camera (up to 60fps), both with 3.6mm f2.0 lens (90-deg field-of-view). <br />

==Ultrasonic Range Sensor==

I think the Maxbotix ultrasonic sensor should be used, We have one avaliable and it has good features. It outputs a range value via a UART in <br />inches (there's no need to figure out ADC conversations and deal with non linearities)

It has a reliable output in the range of approximately 15 cm to 6.25 meters. <br />

==Infrared Range Sensor==

SHARP GP2Y0A710K0F, Measuring sensor already have one from last year and can be intergrated with the ultrasonic range sensor.

==Inertial Measurment Unit==

Sensor Dynamics 6DOF IMU <br />
6 Degrees of Freedom with SPI or UART

==Compass Module==

HMC6343 from Sparkfun. <br />
It's the more expensive one but it has tilt compensation.<br />
I2C interface.<br />

==Hardware Architecture==

This is revision 2 of the architecture, The entire Architecture has been revised. All mode control unit componants have been put into a single <br /> block and a design doc will explain how it all works.
