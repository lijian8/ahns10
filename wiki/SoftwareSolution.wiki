== High Level Objectives System Requirements and Acceptance Tests ==
=== HLO-4 Autonomous Hovering Flight ===
An autopilot system should be developed to enable sustained indoor autonomous hovering flight. The control system should be designed to enable future ingress and egress manerourvers to longitudinal and hovering flight.

*Airborne System Requirements*
|| *System Requirement* || *Definition* || *Acceptance Test* ||
|| SR-4-01 || The airborne control system shall provide control updates at a minimum rate of 50Hz || AT-4-01 ||
|| SR-4-02 || The airborne control system gain and reference parameters shall be updatable in flight using an 802.11g WLAN uplink from the GCS || AT-4-02 ||
|| SR-4-03 || The airborne software shall transmit telemetry data including state data to the GCS using 802.11g WLAN || AT-4-03 ||

----
=== HLO-5 Ground Control Station ===
A ground control station that supports appropriate command and system setting input and data display and logging should be developed. The design should be derived from previous AHNS developments and enable future ground station developments.
