#summary Overview of the AHNS Ground and Airborne Software
== Legacy Architecture ==
  * QtThreads for m:1 Kernal Threads
  * All based on ground computer
  * Split of HMI and AP over UDP linked computers
  * Instructions of building 2009 code [APandHMI here] 
----

== Preliminary Design ==
  * Interface Control Document for Airborne/GCS packets (AHNS-10-SY-IC-001)

=== GCS Design Notes ===
  * Qt Objects
  * QThreads
  * Used for data logging

=== Airborne Design Notes ===
  * Build distro with OpenEmbedded
  * C –libraries is between GNU C (glibc) and micro C (uclibc) 
  * Need support for the desired POSIX NTPL thread library
  * Thread priority
  * State estimation and localisation internal interface with AP (AHNS-10-SY-IC-002)
  * recieves PWM information from UART to MCU to enable command logging in all flight modes
